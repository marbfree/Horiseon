## Description

To create accessibility so the site is optimized for search engines.  I built this project to further educate myself on how to consolidate repetitive styles in CSS and to understand sequencing and proper tags and elements for HTML.  The changes made in the project make the site more accessible and easier to modify.  I learned how to make comments in HTML and to make CSS and HTML more easily readable.

## Credits

## Features

Comments in the CSS section to note any changes.  Accessibility features for search engine optimization.  Usable links.
