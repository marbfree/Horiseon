 <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

To create accessibility so the site is optimized for search engines.  I built this project to further educate myself on how to consolidate repetitive styles in CSS and to understand sequencing and proper tags and elements for HTML.  The changes made in the project make the site more accessible and easier to modify.  I learned how to make comments in HTML and to make CSS and HTML more easily readable.

## Credits

Thank you to my tutor, Sangeetha Kaliaperumal, for validating my understanding of the project and for overseeing some of the changes I made to the main body in HTML and CSS.

## Features
